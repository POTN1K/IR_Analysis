# Project designed by Nikolaus Ricker and Joachim Bron Jacobs

This project has as an objective to analyze a set of infrared images to approximate the transition line in an airfoil.

Main runs the program, though it includes only some of the main functions. Other parts were temporary, such as saving certain files.

The methods in each file are:
*importCSV has functions to import files, convert into readable input, save files, etc.
*analysis normalizes values, creates images and revises for transition line
*generate_graphs takes array input, corrects it and shows appropriate figures

A sample of the results obtained is in directory results. It is the analysis for 3 degress angle of attack of a 3d wing,
process which was repeated from 0-18 degrees in both 2d and 3d.

First unprocessed data is available for comparison, then process, then averaged and normalized, then turned into image,
afterwards, the image is used to find the line, ending with the points of transition and a plot for clearer visualization.

This was a project done for TU Delft Aerospace Engineering Bachelor. The subject is Low-Speed Wind Tunnel Testing.
